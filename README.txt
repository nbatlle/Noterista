A simple project for fun and practice, hopefully something I can eventually use in my work flow. 
This will be a command line app for now since that's how I prefer to work.
Once I've checked my other boxes for this project I'll consider developing a GUI or web version.

(GTD refers to Getting Things Done by David Allen.  See https://gettingthingsdone.com/what-is-gtd/ for more info.)

Goals:
1.  Develop basic CRUD functionality.  Keep it simple and non-object-based for now.
2.  Develop SQL back-end to persist data.
3.  Implement Note class.
4.  Develop GTD functionality.
5.  Streamline UI/UX.
6.  Consider other features such as tags, search function, enabling images/links/etc.
7.  Consider GUI version, web version, etc.
